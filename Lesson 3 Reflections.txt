When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    A remote repository helps when working with a team, so all team members can work simultaneously
    on different parts of the project without interfering with each other.
    
    A remote repository also helps when working from different computers, and also could be considered
    an off-site backup medium.
